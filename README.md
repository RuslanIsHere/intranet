# Intranet App (Personal Project)

This project is inspired by the intranet system I contributed to during my internship at Factory.fr. While visually and functionally influenced by that experience, this version was built entirely from scratch without reusing any source code.

## Overview

A simple intranet-style web application built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **Supabase**, and **Material UI**, deployed on **Vercel**. The app serves as a demonstration of my ability to reproduce real-world application structures and implement key frontend/backend features.

## Features

- Authentication and session handling via Supabase
- Responsive layout with Material UI and custom components
- Modular architecture inspired by real-world enterprise intranets
- CRUD operations with PostgreSQL via Supabase
- Clean and maintainable codebase using TypeScript
- Optimized for deployment on Vercel

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material UI (MUI)
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase (auth, database, storage)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Other Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Git, Vitest

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
